# testdemo
This is a demo.

Moreover, it was written by me. I have done so. This update proves it.

```c#
static void myFunction(int i)
{
  if (i > 5)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Wow, big number!");
  }
  else
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Whomp whomp");
  }
}
```

I have some other work to do:

- [ ] Learn to program everything
- [ ] Grok Microsoft
- [x] ~~Finish employee training~~
